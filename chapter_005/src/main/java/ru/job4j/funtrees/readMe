You are given a binary tree, where every node points to a head of an integer linked list.
Implement the method flatten which returns a sorted linked list from the values of all the lists, without duplicates.

For example, given the following tree:

    17->1
   /  \
  3    1
 /    / \
2    16  7->3

The method should return 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 16 -> 17.

The classes TreeNode & ListNode are available for you:
